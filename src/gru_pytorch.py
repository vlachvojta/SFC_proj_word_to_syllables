# - Getting the time data of each individual time step and generalizing them
#     - Hour of the day *i.e. 0-23*
#     - Day of the week *i.e. 1-7*
#     - Month *i.e. 1-12*
#     - Day of the year *i.e. 1-365*
#     
#     
# - Scale the data to values between 0 and 1
#     - Algorithms tend to perform better or converge faster when features are on a relatively similar scale and/or close to normally distributed
#     - Scaling preserves the shape of the original distribution and doesn't reduce the importance of outliers.
#     
#     
# - Group the data into sequences to be used as inputs to the model and store their corresponding labels
#     - The **sequence length** or **lookback period** is the number of data points in history that the model will use to make the prediction
#     - The label will be the next data point in time after the last one in the input sequence
#

Both models will have the same number of **dimensions** in the *hidden state* and *layers*, trained over the same number of **epochs** and **learning rate**, and trained and tested on the exact same set of data.
# 
# For the purpose of comparing the performance of both models as well, we'll being tracking the time it takes for the model to train and eventually comparing the final accuracy of both models on the test set. For our accuracy measure, we'll use *Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (sMAPE)* to evaluate the models. *sMAPE* is the sum of the **absolute difference** between the predicted and actual values divided by the average of the predicted and actual value, therefore giving a percentage measuring the amount of error. 
# 
# This is the formula for *sMAPE*:
# 
# $sMAPE = \frac{100%}{n} \sum_{t=1}^n \frac{|F_t - A_t|}{(|F_t + A_t|)/2}$

# While the LSTM model may have made smaller errors and edged the GRU model slightly in terms of performance accuracy, the difference is insignificant and thus inconclusive. There have been many other tests conducted by others comparing both these models but there has largely been no clear winner as to which is the better architecture overall.
